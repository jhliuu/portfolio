 <i>Monody</i>, 2025
<br><br><br><br><br>
 This work started from a desire to question how we perceive materials, and more fundamentally, how we define beauty in contemporary art. Beauty today feels like a concept emptied out by the market, replicated and circulated until it loses meaning. I find myself caught between resisting it and still wanting to make something that appears beautiful.<br><br>
        I chose concrete for its weight, its hardness, its associations with construction and permanence. Then I forced it into a form that looks soft, stretched, almost fragile. It resembles the formal language of Brancusi, but the resemblance is uneasy. It is not an homage, but a tension between attraction and critique. I wanted to see if I could make something seductive using a material that resists seduction.<br><br>
        It took nearly two months of trials to see whether this shape could even be made. When it was finally finished, I placed it on a roll of toilet paper. That placement felt right. It was understated, absurd, and strangely sincere. It undercut the effort without fully mocking it.<br><br>
        Maybe beauty now is not about elevation or transcendence. Maybe it is about conflict, about labor spent on something that refuses to mean what it’s supposed to.
